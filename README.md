## Overview

The purpose of this project is to compile data from different UFO encounters around the US and present them on one easy to use webpage.
Tools: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, VSCode Editor

##  Results
The final web page shows a dark page with white fonts, it is a clean and visually appealing page where each element is well uniformed with the text.

--webPageUFOs

we have a filter box for us to commit a search in the UFOs databank:

--filterBox

this is the Initial state of the Search page:

--initialState

As soon as we enter a new search criteria and change our edit box focus the data is updated as in this case:

--filtered

To be able to reset all filters we can go to the beginning af the page and click the "UFO Sightings" link that will take us to the Initial state:

--ufoLink

Initial web page data bank:

--initialState

## Summary

This webpage does give a great overview of UFO sightings in the US, but it does have a few shortcomings, the biggest one is that does not have the functionality to add live data as it comes in, the data that is a part of the data file will stay the same unless someone manually goes in and updates it.

- we can add a dropdown menu for the filters, this way the users have list of options to choose from.

- We can add a bottom back to top to take the user up the beginning of the page once he/she scroll to the bottom.
