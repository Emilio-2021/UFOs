we have a filter box for us to commit a search in the UFOs databank:

As soon as we enter a new search criteria and change our edit box focus the data is updated as in this case:

## Summary

This webpage does give a great overview of UFO sightings in the US, but it does have a few shortcomings, the biggest one is that does not have the functionality to add live data as it comes in, the data that is a part of the data file will stay the same unless someone manually goes in and updates it.

- we can add a dropdown menu for the filters, this way the users have list of options to choose from.

- We can add a bottom back to top to take the user up the beginning of the page once he/she scroll to the bottom.
